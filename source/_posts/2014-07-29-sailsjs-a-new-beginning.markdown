I have recently become twitterpated with a fairly new node-based web framework called Sails. It offers the same great awesomeness that Rails has been giving me for so many years along with some new and exciting features such as:

- Super simple JSON API generation with Blueprints
- Socket.io integration built in
- Concurrency and speed!

Over the next few months, I will be teaching myself this amazing framework starting at version `0.10.0-rc9`. I will be documenting what I learn here and hopefully will provide assistance to others via these posts. This post will serve as a table of contents with links to each tutorial.

Feel free to contact me at any time on #sailsjs (freenode). I am `ericberry` on there.
